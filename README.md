# resizable-panes
Between January and March 2020, I attended <a href="http://www.spiced-academy.com/" target="_blank">SPICED Academy</a>, an intensive 12-week coding program focused on Full Stack JavaScript Web Development in Berlin, Germany. During this program, I built a portfolio of web applications.

Resizeable Panes is an element to display before and after photos.  User simply clicks on the handle to be able to scroll left and right between two images.  These elemnts are very popular with news and blog websites.
